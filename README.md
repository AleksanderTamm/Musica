Music player app for Mobile App dev course

Our app integrates device local music and Spotify music into one app. In one tab, the user can listen to music that’s on their local device (right now the music is preselected by us, and comes with the app). In the other tab the user can listen to their favourite Spotify playlist.
The target audience is everyone, who likes using Spotify, but wants to have a way to listen to both the music available on Spotify and music from their local device.

For this app, it is required to have access to the Spotify app.
Steps to using app:
1) Have access to Spotify in device
2) In Spotify settings, allow other apps to use Spotify
3) Open project in Android Studio
4) On the right hand side, open Gradle submenu
5) Locate “Execute Gradle Task” (a little elephant) button and click on it
6) Type “signingreport” and press enter
7) Locate the SHA-1 key and copy it
8) Send it to Aleksander Tamm on Slack, and wait to get approved
9) App is ready to use either on physical Android device, or a virtual device

The project has been tested on the Google Pixel 2, Huawei P30 pro and Samsung Galaxy S21.
